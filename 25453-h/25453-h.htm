<div class='unindent'><br />he Fairy Violet lived in the heart of a beautiful forest, where,
through the glad spring months, the sun shone softly, and the
bright flowers bloomed, and now and then the gentle rain fell
in silver drops that made every green thing on which they rested
fresher and more beautiful still. At the foot of a stately oak nestled
a clump of violets, and it was there the wee fairy made her home.
She wore a robe of deep violet, and her wings, which were of the
most delicate gauze, glistened like dew-drops in the sun. All day
long she was busy at work tending her flowers, bathing them in the
fresh morning dew, painting them anew with her delicate fairy brush,
or loosening the clay when it pressed too heavily upon their fragile
roots; and at night she joined the elves in their merry dance upon
the greensward. She was not alone in the great forest; near
her were many of her sister fairies, all old friends and playmates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
There was the Fairy Primrose in a gown of pale yellow, and Cowslip,
who wore a robe of the same colour, but of a deeper shade. There
was the graceful Bluebell, and the wild Anemone, the delicate Woodsorrel,
and the Yellow Kingcup. The Fairy Bluebell wore a robe
the colour of the sky on a calm summer's day, Anemone and Woodsorrel
were clad in pure white, while Kingcup wore a gown of
bright amber. One day, as the Fairy Violet was resting from the
noonday heat on the open leaves of her favourite flower, a noisy troop
of boys, just set free from school, came dashing at full speed through
the forest. "Hallo! there is a nest in that tree," cried one, and he
trod ruthlessly on the violets as he sprang up the trunk of the ancient
oak. The Fairy Violet was thrown to the ground, with a shock that
left her for a time stunned and motionless. When she recovered,
the boys were gone, and the flower in which she had been resting lay
crushed and dying on the ground. Filled with tender pity at the
sight, Fairy Violet hastened to tend her wounded charge, taking no
thought for her own injuries. "Dear Violet, be comforted," she
whispered softly, as she raised the drooping flower from the ground;
"I will try to make you well." Then she took her fairy goblet and
fetched a few drops of dew from a shady place which the sun had not
yet reached, to revive the fainting flower, and bound up the broken
stem with a single thread of her golden hair. But it was all in vain,
and the fairy, after wrapping an acorn in soft moss, and placing it for
a pillow beneath the head of the fast fading Violet, left it to try her skill
on the other flowers. A faint fragrance from the dying flower thanked
her, as she turned sadly away to pursue her labour of love. It was
not till she had raised and comforted all the drooping flowers and
bound up their wounds, that the Fairy Violet thought of herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Then she discovered that her delicate gossamer wings were gone!
Evidently they had been caught on a crooked stick as she fell to the
ground and torn violently off, for there the remnants now hung,
shrivelled and useless, flapping in the breeze. At this sight the hapless
fairy threw herself by the side of the now withered Violet, and wept
bitterly. When spring and the spring flowers were gone, and their
work was ended, Violet and her sister fairies had been wont to spread
their wings and fly back to fairy-land, to report to the Queen what
they had done, and to receive from her reward or blame, according as
they had performed their task well or ill. Now this happy prospect
was over for poor Violet. "I shall never see fairy-land again!" she
murmured, and wept anew at the thought.</div>

<p>The violets whom she had tended so lovingly were very sorry for
her grief, and shook their heads gently in the breeze, till their
fragrance filled the air, and stole softly round the weeping fairy.
But though they comforted, they could not help her. Presently she
rose, and glided swiftly through the tall grass, till she reached the
flower where the blue robed fairy was resting after her day's
work.</p>

<p>"Oh, sister Blue Bell," she cried, "I have lost my wings!
Where shall I get another pair, that I may fly back to fairy-land with
you and my sisters when our work is done?" Then Bluebell shook
her head sorrowfully, till all her sweet bells chimed&mdash;"I am sorry!
I am sorry!" but she could not help her sister Violet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Cowslip will know," she suggested.</p>

<p>But Cowslip bade her try what Woodsorrel would say, and
Woodsorrel thought perhaps Kingcup might know, so Violet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
went about from one to another, till she was ready to cry again with
vexation.</p>

<p>Then all the fairies gathered round her and tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Let us ask the owl that sits in the hollow oak," said the gentle
Anenome, gliding to Violet's side; "he must be very wise, for
he never smiles, and seldom speaks more than three words at a
time."</p>

<p>So that night, when the moon lit her silver lamp in the sky, instead
of dancing, as was their wont, with the elves upon the greensward,
they all repaired to the hollow oak to seek an audience of the owl.
They had to repeat their errand two or three times before he understood
it, for the owl was as slow of understanding as he was of
speech, and then, having nodded his head solemnly for five minutes,
and winked and blinked for quite ten, he said solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Try the King of the Fire Spirits!"</p>

<p>After which he relapsed into silence, and obstinately refused to
say any more. Then the Fairy Violet bade farewell to all her friends,
and set out on her journey to the King of the Fire Spirits. She had
a long way to go, for the Fire-King held his court in the very centre
of the earth, and she might have lost herself in the dark passages
had not the glowworm lent her his lamp. She had saved him once
when a hungry bird would have carried him off in her beak, and
from that time the glowworm had loved the gentle fairy, and always
burned brightest when she was by.</p>

<p>The Fairy Violet travelled very quickly, scarcely touching her feet
to the ground, but passing onward with a swift gliding motion that
was very beautiful; still it was three days and three nights before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
she reached the kingdom of the Fire Spirits, for she had four thousand
miles to go.</p>

<p>Had she not been a fairy, she must have been scorched to death
as she entered the Fire-King's domain, for the streets were paved
with molten iron, and flames kept bursting forth in all directions, in
which she could perceive strange wild figures, some leaping to and fro
in mad fantastic glee, playing at ball with lumps of burning coal;
others manufacturing volcanic fire in their monstrous furnaces.</p>

<p>They ceased their employment when they saw Violet, and came
and knelt before her in wondering admiration. She looked so
beautiful as she came floating towards them in her soft violet robe,
with her fair hair rippling in golden waves to her very feet, that
they thought she must be an angel who had strayed down from among
the bright stars to their gloomy dwelling-place, for they had never
seen a fairy before.</p>

<p>They were moved with compassion when they heard her sad tale,
and at once led her before their King, who was seated on a throne
of molten gold, with red and yellow flames curling up and arching
over him for a canopy, and a crown of fire on his head. He looked
rather fierce, but received Violet very graciously, and at once ordered
his head blacksmith to make the little fairy a new pair of wings.
Violet was a little startled when she found that these were made of
fire, and were to be fastened on her shoulders with bands of liquid
gold, but the King assured her that they were the very best of
their kind.</p>

<p>"There is nothing so powerful as fire," he cried, with a fierce
exultant laugh; waving his fiery sceptre in the burning atmosphere
so wildly, that though Violet thought he had been very kind to her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and bade him a very grateful farewell, she was yet not at all sorry
to be safely out of his domains.</p>

<p>How fresh and green the earth looked as she emerged from the
dark caverns that led to the Fire-King's palace, and rested her hot
feet on the cool grass! But when eager to tell her friends of her
success, she began to try the Fire-King's present, a general cry of
dismay and terror broke forth.</p>

<p>"Sister Violet, you are killing our flowers," cried the fairies,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am burning! I am burning!" shrieked the grass.</p>

<p>"Cruel fairy! you have killed us!" murmured the insects, as, with
scorched wings, they fell helpless to the ground.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Violet weeping, "I am bringing death and destruction
wherever I go. I will fly back to fairy-land before I work more
mischief."</p>

<p>But the birds looked down from their nests wild with terror at
the thought.</p>

<p>"You will kill us if you fly up here with your burning wings,"
they chirped piteously. "You will scorch us to death," shouted
the trees, tossing their heads angrily in the breeze.</p>

<p>"Ah, gentle fairy, have pity on us!" cooed the dove; "did I not
comfort you when your pet violet died?"</p>

<p>"Have I not sung to you at night when you were weary with
dancing?" warbled the nightingale.</p>

<p>"Have we not sheltered you from the fierce heat of the sun, and
the beating of the pitiless rain?" rustled the trees, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Heartless!" muttered the wind, rushing rudely past her; "to
injure those who love you so much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall never see fairy-land again!" murmured Violet. But she
had too gentle a heart to persist, so she sadly retraced her steps, and
bade the Fire-King take back his fatal gift.</p>

<p>That evening, she and her sister fairies went to the owl and told
him of the ill success of her mission. The owl heard her to the end
with great gravity, and then said, severely: "Of course! Anyone with
any sense would have known that wings forged by the Fire Spirits
<i>must</i> burn everything they touched."</p>

<p>Violet would have liked to remind him that it was <i>he</i> who bade
her go to the King of the Fire Spirits, but he looked so very severe,
as he sat blinking solemnly in the moonlight, that she was afraid, and
only said, humbly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please what shall I do now?"</p>

<p>"Go to the King of the Snow Spirits, of course!" said the owl,
rather crossly, for he wanted to go to sleep; "if fire is too hot, you
had better try snow."</p>

<p>"Alas! what shall I do?" said Violet, very sadly. "The Snow-King
lives far off by the North Pole, and I have no wings to bear me
to him over the seas."</p>

<p>Then a gentle fluttering was heard in the trees, and a sea-bird
alighted at Violet's feet.</p>

<p>"Beautiful fairy," he sang, softly, "do you not remember now,
three springs ago, when the trees were clothing themselves anew in
their green raiment, and the flowers were springing up among the
fresh grass, you bound up my leg, which the hunter had wounded
with his cruel gun; and fed me daily with luscious fruits, and gave me
to drink of sparkling dew till I recovered? I vowed then that I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
one day repay you, and now my chance has come. Mount on my
back, sweet Violet, and I will carry you to the Snow-King."</p>

<p>Then Violet thanked him joyfully, and seated herself on his back;
and the sea-bird flew away with her far over the hills and vales, and
pleasant fields, and beyond the great ocean till he reached the
palace of the Snow-King.</p>

<p>The Palace was built of blocks of ice, filled in with snow, and
arched over with a graceful snowdrift for a roof; while lofty colonnades
of snow, supported by pillars of ice, led the way to the
audience chamber, which glistened with diamonds and crystals
of the most sparkling brilliancy. The Snow-King wore on his head
a crown of ice-diamonds, while from his shoulders hung gracefully
a pure white cloak, fringed with glittering icicles and fastened at the
neck with a crystal brooch.</p>

<p>Violet shivered a little as she entered this coldly beautiful palace,
for she was accustomed to bask all day long in the warm sunshine,
and had never trod on anything colder than the soft grass; but she
quickly recovered herself, and gliding with a swift graceful movement to
the foot of the Snow-King's throne, she bent on one knee before him,
and told him for what she had come.</p>

<p>Then the Snow-King looked kindly upon the little fairy, and
raised her gently with his ice-cold hands.</p>

<p>"Beautiful fairy," he said, "you are the first of your race who
ever visited my kingdom, and never have I seen aught so radiantly
lovely before. Your wish is granted, I only would it were twice as
costly;" and, turning to the snow-spirits, who were gathering lovingly
round the bright being who had ventured so boldly into their ice-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>bound
regions, he bade them mould wings of the purest and most
delicate snow for their fairy visitant. Then the King lay back on
his throne, and looked at the sweet modest face of the little fairy,
and at her graceful form, with the bright hair rippling in sunny
waves over the violet robe, till, moved by some sudden impulse,
he came and knelt down at Violet's feet.</p>

<p>"Sweet fairy," he said, as Violet turned her wondering eyes upon
him, "I have long ruled as monarch among my Snow-Spirits, and I
have been very proud of the cold splendour of my palace, with its
glittering crystals and pillars of ice, and I have laughed when the
Fire-King has taunted me from afar with its lack of warmth and
colour, for I cared not for either; but now it seems to me that the
bright gleam of your golden hair, and the warm glow of your
violet robe, are far more beautiful than my ice-diamonds and sparkling
crystals, and that my palace will be very bleak and desolate when
you have gone. Stay with us, gentle fairy, and be my queen!"</p>

<p>Then all the Snow-Spirits gathered eagerly round Violet, and
cried, "Stay with us, and be our Queen!"</p>

<p>Violet shivered as their icy-breath blew upon her, and her hand
grew cold in the Snow-King's frozen clasp; but she turned to
him, and said, very gently, for she was sorry to give him pain, "I
cannot leave my beautiful fairy-land to become your Queen. I
should pine away in your beautiful ice-palace, for I love the warm
sunshine and the bright flowers, and the soft breath of balmy spring,
and this cold air would kill me. So do not ask me again, noble
King, for I cannot say yes, and it grieves me to say no."</p>

<p>Then the Snow-King urged her no more, but went back to his
throne, and watched her with such sad, wistful eyes, that Violet's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heart ached, and she was glad when they brought her the wings
that she might fly away.</p>

<p>They were very beautiful, made of soft feathery snow, and fastened
to her shoulders with crystal buckles.</p>

<p>Violet knelt down and kissed the King's hand, thanking him
gratefully for his kindness, and praying him to forgive her any
pain she had caused him; and then flew away side by side
with her faithful bird. The Snow-King watched her till the
bright sheen of her hair, and the soft flutter of her wings could no
longer be seen, and then turned back, sad and lonely, to his
palace.</p>

<p>But Violet was very happy; "I shall see fairy-land again; bright,
beautiful fairy-land!" she sang softly to herself over and over.</p>

<p>But when the frozen seas were past, and she was hovering once
more above the land, the sun shone full upon her, the snow-wings
melted away, and she fell helplessly to the ground.</p>

<p>"Dear Violet, are you hurt?" asked the Fairy Anenome, by
whose side she had fallen. But Violet could not speak. She hid
her face in Anenome's white robe, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Dear sister Violet," said Anenome, winding her arms lovingly
round the weeping fairy, "be comforted. This night we will go
together and seek an audience of the Owl. Perhaps he will give us
wiser counsel this time."</p>

<p>"The Owl only mocks me," said Violet; "I will not ask counsel
from him again."</p>

<p>Then Anenome was silent, for she knew not what else to advise,
and only tried to show her pity by tender words and caresses. But
Fairy Kingcup lifted up her bright face, and said, cheerily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why not try the Wizard of the Black Rock? He lives a long
way off, but he is the wisest magician that ever lived; and if any
one can help our sister Violet, it is he."</p>

<p>Violet shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"I do not know the way," she said.</p>

<p>"I will lead you," hummed a bee, from the deep cup of a
cowslip.</p>

<p>"And I will sing you my merriest songs to cheer you by the way,"
warbled a thrush, circling lovingly round her head.</p>

<p>"And I," cried the glowworm, "will light you at night with my
golden lamp."</p>

<p>"We all love you, Fairy Violet, because you are so gentle and
good," they sang in chorus; and Violet lifted her head, comforted,
and smiled a sweet, joyous smile, as she bade farewell to her sister
fairies.</p>

<p>It was a long journey that she undertook, for the Wizard of the
Black Rock lived quite at the other end of the earth.</p>

<p>Sometimes a benighted traveller, hurrying homewards, fancied he
saw a golden light flash like lightning past his dazzled eyes, or heard
a warbling of sweet music, delighting for an instant his bewildered
ears; but light and music were gone in a moment, and he never
guessed that it was the Fairy Violet who had passed him as she
glided onward with her three faithful attendants to seek the Wizard
of the Black Rock.</p>

<p>At length they reached the great Black Rock, which rose up, grim
and forbidding, from a wide, desolate plain. The bee sank down
humming cheerfully, at the base, the thrush perched himself on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
projecting ridge, and the glowworm hid himself behind a tuft of
withered grass.</p>

<p>Violet advanced boldly to the small black door, studded with iron
nails, which was standing open, guarded only by a black dwarf of preternatural
ugliness. He turned as the beautiful fairy came floating towards
him, and led the way silently through dark long passages, and up
narrow winding stairs to his master's chamber. It was a small dark
room, lighted only by a silver lamp of great brilliancy, which stood
on a table by the fire-place, where, though the month was May, and
the weather bright and sunny, there burned a dim, smouldering fire.
The Wizard, whose silvery locks contrasted strangely with the surrounding
gloom, bent over a book; its jewelled clasps were rusted
with age, each page was enriched with coloured tracery. He was
very old. More than a hundred years had elapsed since it was
first rumoured that a famous magician had taken up his abode in the
Black Rock, and all that time he had spent in studying the great
black book of magic spells that lay open before him. No wonder
he was wise and learned!</p>

<p>The dwarf shut the door with a sullen resentful clang, and Violet
was left alone with the great magician.</p>

<p>She glided to his side, and knelt down meekly before him.</p>

<p>But the Wizard, deep in his abstruse studies, did not hear her;
and Violet felt a sensation of awe creeping over her as she noted
his abstracted gaze, and looked on the high, arched forehead wrinkled
with centuries of years and study. Suddenly the magician turned,
muttering some strange words in an unknown tongue, and, as he
did so, his eyes fell upon Violet.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus_016.png" width="400" height="387" alt="The Fairy Violet visits the Magician." title="The Fairy Violet visits the Magician." />
</div>

<p>A remembrance of some by-gone spell of grace and beauty seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to stir the Wizard as he looked upon the bright-haired fairy, to whose
upturned face the light of the silver lamp had lent a fairer radiance,
for his deep voice softened as he spoke to her, and he laid his hand
gently on her head while she told her story.</p>

<p>When she had finished, he remained musing for some time in
silence.</p>

<p>"I know no spells that will serve where the Spirits of Snow and of
Fire have failed," he said at length, with unwonted gentleness. "No
one can help thee here but thine own loving heart. Kind words,
gentle deeds, faithful service, patient waiting&mdash;from these alone can
be wrought the wings, which will be slight enough for thy delicate
frame to bear, and yet powerful enough to withstand every trial. Go
forth then, gentle fairy, to thy daily tasks, and wait patiently till the
great Mother Nature herself give thee thy reward."</p>

<p>"Thanks, kind magician," said Violet, with a bright smile; "you
have given me a pleasant task to do."</p>

<p>Then kissing gratefully his withered hand, she went on her way,
and the aged Magician thought his silver lamp burned dimly,
and his cell grew dark when she had left.</p>

<p>"Could not the great wizard help you?" cried her three
friends, sorrowfully, as, gliding past the black dwarf that guarded
the entrance, she stepped out into the open air.</p>

<p>"Could he not help you?" echoed her sister fairies, when she
re-entered once more the old forest.</p>

<p>"Alas! is there no help for you, sweet Violet?" wept the wind,
wandering in and out among the lofty trees, rocking and swaying them
like slender bulrushes in his fierce sorrow.</p>

<p>But to each and all Violet replied only by a glad quiet smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Patience!" she said, gently; "Mother Nature will help me
in her own time."</p>

<p>So she returned to her work among the violets; and when they
had all died, and the spring had gone, and her sister fairies flew
away to fairy-land, she still smiled, though a little sadly, and
bade them farewell without a shade of discontent in her brave,
gentle voice.</p>

<p>"Now, I must find some work," she said to herself, when her
wistful eyes could no longer discern the flutter of their wings in the
azure sky.</p>

<p>And she soon found plenty to do.</p>

<p>Now it was binding up the wound of some stricken bird, or raising
some crushed flower, and sprinkling its drooping leaves with cooling
dew, and now it was closing the eyelids of a tired child who had
thrown himself down to rest beneath the forest shade, and singing
softly in his ear a fairy lullaby, till he fell asleep. Sometimes she
would perch herself on the shoulder of some sleeping wayfarer by
the roadside, and whisper in his ear sweet and tender words that
made him dream of his home, and of the mother sleeping so peacefully
in the churchyard far away, till he started from his sleep and
went on his way with a touched and softened heart. Every day
Fairy Violet found some kindly deed to do, and every day Mother
Nature, looking lovingly on her child, saw the time was drawing
nearer when she should receive her reward.</p>

<p>One day as she was wandering through one of the by-streets of a
crowded city, she was attracted by a plaintive voice that proceeded from
one of the low-roofed, badly built houses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put the geranium where I can see it, mother," the voice was
saying, "I love to lie back and watch it."</p>

<p>A woman came forward at these words and altered the position
of the plant, which Fairy Violet had already noticed as being
rather faded, and in want of her skill to brighten the colours.</p>

<p>"It is very washy-like," she said regretfully, "I doubt this
stuffy air is killing it."</p>

<p>"Will it live as long as I shall?" asked the plaintive voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but Violet saw that the mother's hands
shook as they busied themselves with the flower.</p>

<p>"I hope it will," the voice continued, with a sort of wistful
eagerness, "for it is such a pleasure to me to watch it. It seems to
comfort me, when the pain is very bad, and I lie awake through
the long weary night, to look at it and wonder what the little
garden is looking like in the old home you have told me of so
often, mother, and whether the moon is shining as sweetly there as
over our poor house here. I sometimes wonder, too, whether the
flowers there are so very much more beautiful than my poor sickly
geranium, and whether if I saw them I should care for it no
longer; and then I think no, that no flower could ever be so beautiful
to me as my flower, and that I love it far better, rearing its pretty
head so bravely in this dull stuffy room, than if it bloomed in the
loveliest garden that was ever planted. And many a time when I
have felt a little downhearted, with being a burden to you, mother,
and the pain seeming as if it was more than I could bear, it has
seemed to say; 'Patience! poor little Faith, it will be over soon.'
Do you think there will be flowers in heaven, mother?"</p>

<p>"Like enough, child," said the woman, dreamily; "there will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
everything that is beautiful there, I expect," and she heaved a deep
sigh. Poor woman! there was little of beauty in her present life,
and the country home of which her child had spoken was but a
far off recollection to her now.</p>

<p>"I should like to have it near me when I die," the sick girl went
on, "I have never had a friend you know, mother, but my flower has
seemed to stand in the place of one to me, and I should like to look
at it just at the last."</p>

<p>"Lord love you, child! don't talk of dying; unless you want to
break my heart," said the mother, with a tone of sharp impatience in
which there was more of grief than of anger.</p>

<p>While she was speaking, Fairy Violet glided in at the open
door.</p>

<p>The room was poor, but scrupulously clean, and the scanty furniture
was as bright as diligent rubbing could make it. On a rude
couch, opposite the open window, lay a girl of about sixteen years
of age, but with a wan-pinched face that made her look ten years
older. Constant pain had blanched all the colour she might once have
possessed, and the blue veins showed clearly through the thin transparent
skin. She turned her head as Violet entered, and a faint
flush of pleasure rose on her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mother! do you smell the violets?" she exclaimed, eagerly,
"the room seems filled with fragrance."</p>

<p>"It must be your fancy, child," said the woman wearily; "I
smell nought."</p>

<p>By this time Violet had settled herself in one of the blossoms of
the geranium, and was busy at work.</p>

<p>"Look, look, mother!" cried the sick girl again, "this at least is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
no fancy;" and mother and daughter gazed at the flower in amazement
as the faded colour grew bright under the fairy's magic touch.
"'Tis the moving it to a sunnier spot, or mayhap 'twas the water
I gave it this morning," said the woman, recovering herself with
a start. "I'll give it a drop more," and she bustled off to get
some, while her daughter lay back and watched the flower with
a quiet, restful smile on her patient lips.</p>

<p>"There is work for me to do here," said Violet to herself, feeling
quite happy as she glided from blossom to blossom, touching and
re-touching with her delicate brush. So she stayed, and day by day
the flower grew more radiantly beautiful beneath her loving hands,
sweetest fragrance filled the room, and softest murmuring of fairy
music floated on the air, which, though the dull senses of mother
and daughter failed to interpret rightly, yet stole into their hearts
and gave them comfort. Sometimes a vision would come before
her of the radiant fairy-land from which she was banished, or of her
beautiful forest-home where fragrant flowers had wrapt her in their
dewy leaves, where birds had sung to her from the leafy bower
above her head, and the bright sun had shone upon her with
genial warmth. But she would quickly banish such thoughts, and
gliding round the room would touch every dull corner with her
fairy wand till it shone and brightened with a magic charm,
would cast a spell upon the smouldering fire, so that it burned and
crackled cheerily, would lay her cool hand upon the sick girl's
throbbing brow till the pain abated, and would cast a fairy haze
before her languid eyes, so that they saw beautiful visions in the
changeful sky.</p>

<p>So day by day passed by, till one morning, bending over a glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that stood beneath the flower she was painting, Fairy Violet saw her
own reflection in the clear water. But she saw something more!
A pair of wings of the most delicate gossamer, tipped with silver and
sparkling with a marvellous radiance, had sprung from her shoulders
and rose almost on a level with her tiny head! Fairy Violet had
won her wings at last, and the golden gates of Fairy-land, where
the woods and forests were always green, and the valleys ever
radiant with beautiful flowers, were open to her once more.</p>

<p>Wild with joy, she darted out of the window, and was already far
above the tops of the smoky chimneys, when she remembered the
patient suffering girl whose life was slowly wasting away in the close
confined atmosphere of her miserable home. Then her wings drooped
and her bright face clouded over.</p>

<p>"I must not leave my work unfinished," she said, and with a wistful
glance at the white fleecy clouds that seemed to beckon lovingly to her,
she returned to the cottage; and the dying girl's last days were
brightened by the fairy presence of which she was so unconscious.</p>

<p>She knew not that it was from Violet the murmuring music came
that delighted her wondering ears, that it was to her she owed the
sweet fragrance that filled the air, and the soft fresh colouring of
the flower at which she loved to gaze; but though the gentle fairy
got no thanks, she felt well rewarded for her labour of love when
she saw the peaceful smile that rested on Faith's wasted face, and
the light that beamed in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>At last the end came. One evening as the sun was sinking to
rest in great waves of crimson and gold, Faith asked for her flower
to be brought to her, smiled faintly as her dim eyes rested on it for
the last time, laid her head on her mother's breast, and died. A low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
wailing cry broke from the mother as she felt that never again would
the dark eyes be raised lovingly to hers, or the wan face brighten
at her approach; but Violet saw what the mother failed to see, that
white-robed angels had gathered round the death-bed, and were now
bearing away the freed spirit with strains of triumphant joy. So
she framed the glorious vision into a song, which she sang in the
woman's ear, and the mother was comforted, though she knew not
why.</p>

<p>"'Tis better so, my poor lamb," she murmured, while tears dropped
slowly one by one down her sunken cheeks. "There is no pain
where thou art gone, nor hunger either, and I will join thee there
by-and-bye."</p>

<p>Then Violet knew that her work was done, and she flew out of
the open window, and up into the clear sky, far above the tops of
the tall chimneys, and some men, who were looking up from the
dusty streets at the sunset, wondering whether the next day would
be fine or wet, caught a sudden gleam of her silver-tipped wings,
and thought it was a flash of summer lightning, and were conscious
at the same moment of a delicious fragrance as of violets, and said
the wind must be from the west, for it was wafting to them country
scents. Fairy Violet laughed as she heard their blundering guesses,
a laugh that rippled out on the still air like the chiming of silver
bells, and then flew joyously on to thank the Wizard of the Black
Rock for his wise counsel.</p>

<p>But when she reached the Black Rock, she found the magician,
wearied out with a succession of sleepless nights spent in abstruse
study and deep research, had fallen fast asleep, with his venerable
head resting on the mysterious book, and the black dwarf at his feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
jealously guarding his slumber. So she trimmed his silver lamp
for him afresh, so that it burned with a yet more wonderful brilliance,
laid a cluster of sweet flowers beside him, and then gladly flitting
from the gloomy rock, spread her glistening wings, and darted up
into the air; up, up, far above the tops of the lofty trees, flashing
like a bright vision through the now darkening night. She passed
the silver moon, which was shining calmly down upon the world
she had just left; she threaded her way in and out among the
golden stars; on, on she went till she saw the beautiful radiant
light that never dims, and heard the soft murmuring of sweet music,
and smelled the delicious fragrance of Fairy-land.</p>

<p>As she passed through the golden gates she heard a great shout of,
"'Tis the Fairy Violet!" and instantly all the bells of Fairy-land
began to ring, and a gay procession of radiant fairies, all dressed in
their fairest robes, came to meet her, and pressed round her with
loving welcome and congratulation. "Come to our Queen, for she
is waiting for you," they cried; and led her in triumph up the
shining steps of the Fairy Palace, and into the Hall of Pearl, where
the Queen was seated on her throne dispensing the graceful wreaths,
which, woven by her own hand, were the choicest rewards bestowed
in Fairy-land. It was easy to adjudge the crowns of merit among
the fairies, for their beauty increased, or waned, according as they
had done well or ill.</p>

<p>Now, every one looking on the Fairy Violet saw that she was the
most beautiful of all, for her face was so radiantly lovely, that none
but the purest fairies could look on it undazzled. So when the Queen,
after greeting Violet with her sweetest smiles, had asked, "To whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
shall I give the fairest crown?" they all shouted unanimously, "To
our Sister Violet!"</p>

<p>But Violet lifted her gentle face with a pleading gesture.</p>

<p>"May it please your Majesty," she said, earnestly, "I do not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'desevre'">deserve</ins>
to be so highly honoured; my sisters have all done as well as I
have."</p>

<p>"No, little Violet," said the Queen, smiling, "you have done best
of all. We well know what your work has been.&mdash;Listen!"</p>

<p>Then Violet listened, and she heard a wondrous song, which, rising
and falling with each change of the fitful breeze, now broke into a
wild strain of piercing sweetness, and anon died away into a soft
musical murmur like the rippling of fairy streams.</p>

<p>"That song, little Violet," said the Queen, "is the record of your
life on earth.&mdash;Listen again."</p>

<p>They all listened, while the marvellous strain sang of Violet's gentle
life on earth.</p>

<p>Not a loving word she had ever said, not a kind deed she had ever
done, not a smile her loving arts had brought to the lips of the dying
girl, not a blessing uttered by the mother unconscious to whom she
owed the peace and quiet of her daughter's last days; not a fragrant
breath from rescued flower, not a song from grateful bird, but added
its sweet note to that marvellous song.</p>

<p>Had there been one unkind word, one selfish thought, one cruel
deed, the song would have been broken by jarring discords; but all
was harmony, not one harsh note disturbed the rippling melody.</p>

<p>As one by one Violet's beautiful secrets were brought to light,
the fairies looked on her with loving admiration, but Violet was quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ashamed at being praised so openly, and hid her blushing face on
Anenome's shoulder.</p>

<p>When the story of Violet's deeds was ended, and the wild mysterious
music had lulled into inarticulate murmuring, the Fairy Queen
looked round upon her subjects, and asked once more, "To whom
shall I give the fairest crown?"</p>

<p>And all the fairies cried again, more eagerly than ever&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Violet! To Violet!"</p>

<p>Then Violet could refuse no longer, but bent gracefully on one
knee before the throne, while the Queen placed the crown on her
shining hair.</p>

<p>The wonderful music died away into silence, and was never heard
again, but the court-minstrel who had listened eagerly to its wild strains,
caught the beautiful melody, and repeated it on his harp; and to
this day, at fairy-feast and revel, the favourite legend is that which
tells how the Fairy Violet lost and won her wings.</p>
